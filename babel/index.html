        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
          It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, 
          a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to 
          provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, 
          and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and 
          statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by 
          supplementing it with additional objects; for example: </p>
        <p>- Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control 
          a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions 
          allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events 
          such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p>
        <p>- Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to 
          running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an 
          application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information 
          from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations 
          on a server. </p>

        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
        <p>- A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). </p>
        <p>- Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</p>
        <p>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the 
          tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript. </p>

        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some 
          others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static 
          typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, 
          naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it 
          was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript. </p>
        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, 
          JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types 
          representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based 
          object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based
           model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for 
           individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special 
           declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as 
           loosely typed methods. </p>
